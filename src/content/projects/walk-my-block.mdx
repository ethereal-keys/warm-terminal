## Overview

Walk My Block creates a living museum of your city. Users share audio logs
or polaroids tagged to their current location—content that only others
can discover by physically stumbling onto that spot.

## The Concept

Imagine walking down a quiet street and your phone buzzes. Someone recorded
a memory here three months ago. You listen. A stranger's voice tells you
about the coffee shop that used to be on this corner, or the time they
proposed right where you're standing.

## Technical Implementation

Built as a web application with Stadia Maps, featuring:

- Beautiful watercolor map overlay aesthetic
- Location-tagged audio recording and playback
- Polaroid-style photo uploads
- Proximity-based content discovery
- Offline-first architecture for spotty coverage areas

## The Hackathon

Prototyped for Hacks-for-Humanity hackathon, where it was selected as an
org favourite. The judges loved the emphasis on human connection and
the way it encourages people to explore their neighborhoods.

## Reflections

### What Made It Special
- The serendipity of discovery
- Low-friction content creation
- The watercolor aesthetic softened the digital experience

### Future Possibilities
- Curated walking tours by local historians
- Integration with city archives
- Ambient soundscapes for areas without user content
