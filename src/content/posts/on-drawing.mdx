A few curves is all it takes.

A C-shape for the torso, a longer sweep for the leg bearing weight,
a quick flick for the one that isn't. Two minutes, maybe less. The
figure on your page doesn't look like the person in front of you.
It looks like the *feeling* of the person in front of you. The
weight, the lean, the tension in the shoulders.

That's what hooked me.

I didn't start drawing seriously until college. Before that it was
doodling in notebook margins, the kind of thing you do when your
hands need something to do and your brain needs somewhere quieter.
In college, that need got louder. Crowded rooms, long lectures,
the kind of days where my focus would scatter if my hands stayed
still.

So I drew. Not well. Not with purpose. Just lines on paper until
the noise quieted down.

Somewhere in there, gesture drawing found me. The idea that a
human body, in all its complexity, could be captured in a few
confident strokes. That a still image could look like it was
about to move. That's the feeling I chase every time I pick up
a pen. Not accuracy. *Movement.*

## The Burst Problem

Here's the thing nobody tells you about creative practice: wanting
it badly doesn't make it happen consistently.

I go weeks without touching a sketchbook. Then something shifts.
Some restlessness builds up, or I see a face that I need to put
on paper, or I just can't sit still anymore. And then I draw for
hours.

<Comic

  alt="Ink portrait of a man in rain, taped to a board"
  caption="One of those bursts. Black pen, cheap paper, taped to a board afterward because I liked how it turned out."
  width="70%"
/>

The bursts produce my best work. The portraits with real weight
behind them, the ones where the linework feels alive. But bursts
aren't discipline. And craft requires discipline.

I know the gap between where I am and where I want to be is
made of all the days I didn't draw. That's my oldest creative
frustration. I suspect it's a common one.

## What Ink Teaches You

There's a thing that happens when you draw with ink. You can't
undo.

Pencil lets you hedge. Digital lets you ctrl+z. Ink is permanent
the moment it touches paper. You commit to a line before you know
if it's right. And when it's wrong (and it will be wrong), you
don't erase it. You work with it. You let the mistake become part
of the drawing, or you push the next line harder to compensate.

I won't pretend this makes you a better software engineer. But
the patience it requires, sitting with something that isn't
working and resisting the urge to start over, finding the next
right line instead of mourning the last wrong one, that patience
is transferable. Not as a skill. As a temperament.

<Callout type="note">
Drawing is a reminder that some things can only be *practiced*.
There's no architecture to refactor, no algorithm to improve.
Just your hand, your eye, and the gap between what you see and
what you can put on paper. That gap never fully closes. You just
get more comfortable living inside it.
</Callout>

## The Process Is the Point

I work in machine learning. I built a neural style transfer
plugin that teaches a network to paint like Van Gogh in real-time.
I've spent more hours than I'd like to admit training models on
artistic data. So I don't say any of this from the outside.

AI image generation is impressive. The outputs are often
beautiful. That's not the interesting question.

The interesting question is: what do you lose if the only images
you ever make are the ones you type a sentence to produce?

<Comic
  src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png"
  alt="XKCD 1205: Is It Worth the Time?"
  caption="This chart doesn't have a column for 'things worth doing even if they're not efficient.'"
/>

You lose the hours of bad gesture drawings that eventually
produce one good one. The specific frustration of getting a
jawline wrong three times before the fourth attempt lands.
The evening spent on a ruffled collar that you almost gave
up on twice before the whole composition clicked.

<Comic
  src="/images/writing/ink-and-patience/ram-horned-woman.jpeg"
  alt="Detailed ink drawing of a woman with ram horns and ruffled collar"
  caption="That collar took longer than the rest of the drawing combined."
  width="70%"
/>

When I look at this drawing, I don't just see the image. I
remember making it. The way the horns came together before
the face did. The moment I almost scrapped the collar and the
moment it started working. That story is part of what the
drawing *is*. It exists because I sat with it for hours, not
because I described it in a sentence.

Even watching someone else draw has this quality. Seeing a
person who has mastered a craft, or who is visibly in the
middle of mastering it, the hand moving with intention, the
mistakes left in. There's something there that no output,
however polished, can carry on its own.

The efficiency argument misses the point entirely. Of course
a prompt is faster than a pen.

Art is more than the artifact. It's the making of it. And
the making is something you have to do with your hands.

## The Pen Is Still Here

My sketchbook is on my desk right now. The brush pen is next
to it. I haven't opened it in eleven days. I know this because
I checked before writing this sentence.

Tomorrow it might be twelve. Or tomorrow I might draw for three
hours and fill four pages and feel like myself again.

That's how it works. The practice isn't daily. The desire is.
And I think that's enough to keep going, even if it doesn't
look like discipline from the outside.

If you're an engineer who used to draw, or who always wanted
to, or who doodles in meetings and feels vaguely guilty about
it: the pen is still there. Pick it up. Draw badly. Draw the
same face six times until the seventh one has something in it
you can't explain.

It won't make you a better programmer. It'll make you a more
patient person. And those are sometimes the same thing.
